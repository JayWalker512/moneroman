Moneroman
=========

Ala, Monero Manager. This is a launcher script which allows changing the CPU 
usage of a process (for example, a crypto-currency mining program) when specific 
other processes are running, as specificed by a whitelist.
This is done by killing the managed process, and restarting it with the 
appropriate performance restrictions applied.

Configuring
===========

The script defines several variables which are used for configuration. You
will find them at the top of the `moneroman.sh` file with comments explaining use.
